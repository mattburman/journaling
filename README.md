# Journaling

I currently use DayOne for journaling, which supports Markdown. This repo contains my templates.

## [Daily Journal](https://github.com/mattburman/journaling/blob/master/daily.md)

It is modelled around [the 5 minute journal](https://www.intelligentchange.com/products/the-five-minute-journal) with some additions that I am experimenting with.

## Weekly Journal

This is largely just an experiment. I've not done it long enough to see the benefits because I keep slacking. We'll see.
